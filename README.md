# Shopping Cart
    a simple shopping cart 
## Goals
the purpose of this project is to work on react concepts learned in the odin project so far:
 - React testing using [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/). I have a lot of practice needed in this area.
 - Adding Typechecking. I'll forego using typescript and aim to use just PropTypes.
 - [React Router](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
 - using [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
 - Solidify and improve on fetching data using [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/)
