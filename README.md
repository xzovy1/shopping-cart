# Shopping Cart
a simple shopping cart with 3 pages and a nav bar.
 - Home page
 - Items page
 - Checkout page
## Goals
the purpose of this project is to work on react concepts learned in the odin project so far:
 - React testing using [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).
 - Adding Typechecking. I'll forego using typescript and aim to use just PropTypes.
 - [React Router](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
 - using [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
 - Solidify and improve on fetching data using [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/)

## Component and Folder structure
### 'Home Page'
- Simple animations/ welcome page
- button component to enter shop

### Shop component(2 pages):
- 'Shopping Page':
    - displays items for sale Grid layout of fetched items. 
    - 'Nav bar' fixed in place displaying item names and quantity.
- 'Checkout page' displays similar to sidebar as its own page which acts as confirmation area.
    - "check out now" button will just empty the cart showing a pop up window with something like "Order received!"
